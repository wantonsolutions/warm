\section{Conclusion}

In this work we present techniques for resolving in-network contention
for passive remote memory. We show that by transparently resolving
conflicts in flight, {\sword} dramatically improves the performance of
optimistic conflict management.  Moreover, we describe how it is
possible to replace atomic memory operations with traditional reads
and writes to avoid performance limitations inherent in such
heavyweight operations.
