\section{Discussion and future work}

Our approach only measures the benefits which clover observers by using our in
network contention resolution. However our approach is general, and in the
future we would like to add functionality for different systems. For example
Remote Regions~\cite{reigons} implements a POSIX file system API for remote
memory.  Our approach could also be used to remove contention here in a much
more standardized remote memory environment.

Clover represents a state of the art key value store for remote memory, however
it is designed with a different set of assumptions than we anticipate for future
systems. We believe that in the context of remote memory with programmable middle
boxes we should architect remote algorithms differently. Mainly that algorithms
and data structures should be designed with the assumption that conflicts can be
resolved using small amounts of high speed compute in network. We aim to explore
the design space of such algorithms and data structures in the future.
