Helios is an operating system designed to simplify the task of writing,
deploying, and tuning applications for heterogeneous platforms. Helios
    introduces satellite kernels, which export a single, uniform set of OS
    abstractions across CPUs of disparate architectures and performance
    characteristics. Access to I/O services such as ﬁle systems are made
    transparent via remote message passing, which extends a standard
    microkernel message-passing abstraction to a satellite kernel
    infrastructure. Helios retargets applications to available ISAs by
    compiling froman intermediate language. To simplify deploying and tuning
    application performance, Helios exposes an afﬁnity metric to developers.
    Afﬁnity provides a hint to the operating system about whether a process
    would beneﬁt from executing on the same platform as a service it depends
    upon.  We developed satellite kernels for an XScale programmable I/O card
    and for cache-coherent NUMA architectures. We ofﬂoaded several applications
    and operating system components, often by changing only a single line of
    metadata. We show up to a 28% performance improvement by ofﬂoading tasks to
    the XScale I/O card. On a mail-server benchmark, we show a 39% improvement
    in performance by automatically splitting the application among multiple
    NUMA domains.

title = {The Multikernel: A new OS architecture for scalable multicore systems},
booktitle = {22nd Symposium on Operating Systems Principles},
year = {2009},
month = {October},
abstract = {Commodity computer systems contain more and more processor cores and exhibit increasingly diverse architectural tradeoffs, including memory hierarchies, interconnects, instruction sets and variants, and IO configurations. Previous high-performance computing systems have scaled in specific cases, but the dynamic nature of modern client and server workloads, coupled with the impossibility of statically optimizing an OS for all workloads and hardware variants pose serious challenges for operating system structures.

We argue that the challenge of future multicore hardware is best met by embracing the networked nature of the machine, rethinking OS architecture using ideas from distributed systems. We investigate a new OS structure, the multikernel, that treats the machine as a network of independent cores, assumes no inter-core sharing at the lowest level, and moves traditional OS functionality to a distributed system of processes that communicate via message-passing.

We have implemented a multikernel OS to show that the approach is promising, and we describe how traditional scalability problems for operating systems (such as memory management) can be effectively recast using messages and can exploit insights from distributed systems and networking.  An evaluation of our prototype on multicore systems shows that, even on present-day machines, the performance of a multikernel is comparable with a conventional OS, and can scale better to support future hardware.

abstract = {Technologies like RDMA and Gen-Z, which give access to memory outside the box, are gaining in popularity. These technologies provide the abstraction of far memory, where memory is attached to the network and can be accessed by remote processors without mediation by a local processor. Unfortunately, far memory is hard to use because existing data structures are mismatched to it. We argue that we need new data structures for far memory, borrowing techniques from concurrent data structures and distributed systems. We examine the requirements of these data structures and show how to realize them using simple hardware extensions},

abstract = {Emerging datacenter applications operate on vast datasets that are kept in DRAM to minimize latency. The large number of servers needed to accommodate this massive memory footprint requires frequent server-to-server communication in applications such as key-value stores and graph-based applications that rely on large irregular data structures. The fine-grained nature of the accesses is a poor match to commodity networking technologies, including RDMA, which incur delays of 10-1000x over local DRAM operations. We introduce Scale-Out NUMA (soNUMA) -- an architecture, programming model, and communication protocol for low-latency, distributed in-memory processing. soNUMA layers an RDMA-inspired programming model directly on top of a NUMA memory fabric via a stateless messaging protocol. To facilitate interactions between the application, OS, and the fabric, soNUMA relies on the remote memory controller -- a new architecturally-exposed hardware block integrated into the node's local coherence hierarchy. Our results based on cycle-accurate full-system simulation show that soNUMA performs remote reads at latencies that are within 4x of local DRAM, can fully utilize the available memory bandwidth, and can issue up to 10M remote memory operations per second per core.},

This paper explores the implications of disaggregation on application fault tolerance. We expect that resource failures in a DDC will be fine-grained because resources will no longer fate-share. In this context, we look at how DDCs can provide legacy applications with familiar failure semantics and discuss fate sharing granularities that are not available in existing datacenters. We argue that fate sharing and failure mitigation should be programmable, specified by the application, and primarily implemented in the SDN-based network.},
