\section{Conclusion}

We present techniques for resolving in-network contention for passive remote
memory and show that by resolving conflicts in flight, {\sword} dramatically
improves the performance of pessimistic atomics and optimistic conflicts. We
provide a P4 and DPDK prototype which demonstrate significant performance gains.

% Moreover, we describe how it is
% possible to replace atomic memory operations with traditional reads
% and writes to avoid performance limitations inherent in such
% heavyweight operations.
