% Effectively sharing passive remote memory remains an open problem.
% While emerging standards like CXL promise cache-coherent memory
% pooling, spec-compliant hardware is not yet commercially
% available and its feasibility at scale remains unproven.

% Existing RDMA-based systems employ optimistic concurrency
% approaches that defer serialization to the remote memory server and
% rely upon heavyweight RDMA atomics to ensure consistency.
% Unfortunately, atomic operations scale poorly causing these approaches
% to degrade rapidly under contention.

% We present \sword, an approach to leveraging the
% \textit{de facto} serialization point in rack-scale disaggregated
% systems---the top-of-rack switch---to transparently resolve data races
% in flight.  In cases where \sword\ has sufficient resources to
% interpose on all requests, it can remove heavyweight atomic operations and
% replace them with simple verbs, avoiding the hardware
% performance bottleneck.  More generally, however, it can
% safely operate on only a subset of the requests, dynamically adjusting
% contending requests to avoid expensive client-based resolution in
% those cases.  Under a YCSB-A workload, our P4-based prototype
% dramatically improves the performance of Clover, a state-of-the-art
% disaggregated key-value store: throughput rises by nearly $35\times$
% while bandwidth usage and tail latency drop by 16 and 300$\times$, respectively.
