\section{Conclusion}

We leverage the top-of-rack switch to resolve in-network
contention and enable efficient sharing of remote memory.
%for passive remote memory and show that by resolving
%conflicts in flight,
{\sword} can improve the performance of systems that rely on
atomic operations and optimistic concurrency. Our
full-featured prototype demonstrates the potential of
removing atomic operations and relying entirely upon
queue-pair ordering guarantees.  While connection
multiplexing is currently gated by the single-core
performance of DPDK, our P4 steering implementation shows
order-of-magnitude gains in the context of one of the
highest-performing systems available.

% Moreover, we describe how it is
% possible to replace atomic memory operations with traditional reads
% and writes to avoid performance limitations inherent in such
% heavyweight operations.
