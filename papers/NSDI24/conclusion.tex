\section{Conclusion}

We leverage the top-of-rack switch to provide cross-client
ordering semantics unavailable in today's RDMA standard,
dramatically increasing performance of systems that rely on
atomic operations and optimistic concurrency.  Concretely,
we show that \sword\ can resolve in-network contention and
enable efficient sharing of remote memory on commodity RDMA
NICs.  for passive remote memory and show that by resolving
conflicts in flight,
Our full-featured DPDK prototype demonstrates the potential of
 removing atomic operations and relying entirely upon queue-pair
 ordering guarantees.
% While connection multiplexing is currently
% gated by the single-core performance of DPDK, our P4 steering
% implementation shows order-of-magnitude gains in the context of one
% of the highest-performing systems available.

% This paper does not raise any ethical issues.
% Moreover, we describe how it is
% possible to replace atomic memory operations with traditional reads
% and writes to avoid performance limitations inherent in such
% heavyweight operations.
