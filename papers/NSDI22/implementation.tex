\section{Implementation}

Our prototype is implemented in a software switch using DPDK, but is designed to
have low memory and computational overhead making it ideal for network devices
such as programmable switches.  RDMA packets are not intended to be modified in
flight, and care must be taken not to corrupt them. RDMA invariant CRCs (ICRC)
are calculated at the time of sending and are designed to ensure the integrity
of the payload. When we modify \texttt{c\&s} packets their ICRC must be
recalculated or the packet will be rejected by the receiving NIC. FPGA
implementations of RDMA ICRC have been built in the past~\cite{Mansour_2019};
the required CRC calculation is identical to Ethernet CRC, with some additional
header components and field masking.  Our DPDK solution uses \texttt{zlib}'s
\texttt{crc32} for the calculation.  We believe that this algorithm can also be
implemented efficiently on a programmable switch.
