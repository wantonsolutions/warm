\section{Conclusion}

In this work we present techniques for resolving in network contention for
remote memory. We show that by programmatically solving contention at a network
serialization point all conflicts can be removed. Second we show that in the
absence of contention, atomic memory operations can be replaced with traditional
reads and writes for a signification performance increase.
