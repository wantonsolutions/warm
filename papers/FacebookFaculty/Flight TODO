1) [X]  make a 2 stage diagram for slide 4
    [X] Show remote memory pages being back
    [X] use colors to show which clients are using which pages

2) [X] slide 5 Add a visualization of shared memory, something really high level which extends the figure from 4

3) [X] Slide 6 improve diagram to show a CAS operation settting a lock. (perhaps add a concurrent read from another client)

4) [ ]Slide 9) think very hard about this one, it could get 30-60 min on it's own
    - focus on Atomcis vs Connection

5) [X] Slide 10) Add lock caching information
    - remove traces of device mapped memory.
    - use the results in orange as a partial result just like Alex suggested
    - add aversion of the locking figure, but remove the bottom half.

6) [X] Slide 11) Focus on failures in general, add a brief optimistic point about not talking towards locks anymore

7) [X] slides 19-22 make a clover only version
    - add a write only version
    - finally add the read and write line

Todo's round 2) 
[ ] Slide 9.. Rough attempt in the next half hour
    --Try multiple times and determine which path is the best
